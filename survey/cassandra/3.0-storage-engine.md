## Detail

'The principal motivation is that new storage engine more directly manipulate the structure that is exposed through CQL, and knowing that structure at the storage engine level has many advantages: some features are easier to add and the engine has more information to optimize'

### The old way

Memory Old

- `Map<byte[], SortedMap<byte[], Cell>>`
  - first `byte[]` is the partition key
  - second `byte[]` is the cluster key
  - `Cell` has value and timestamp

Problem

- The encoding of CQL over the legacy storage engine involves quite a few inefficiencies and duplication.
  - NOTE: in the 1.0 documentation for C*, when they talk about sparse row, they say C* store column name in rows to trade space for flexibility

### The New way

- `Map<byte[], SortedMap<Clustering, Row>>`
  - `Clustering` holds the clustering columns of the CQL row it now represents
  - `Row` represent a given CQL row, associating to each column their value and timestamp

### The storage format

Old

-  each non-primary-key column of a CQL row is encoded by a different “cell”, with both the column name and the full values of the clustering columns repeated every time

````sql
CREATE TABLE events (
       id uuid,
       received_at timeuuid,
       property_1 int,
       property_2 text,
       property_3 float,
       PRIMARY KEY (id, received_at)
);
````

- `id` is the partition key
- `received_at` is the clustering key

````sql
INSERT INTO events (id, received_at, property_1, property_2, property_3)
                VALUES (de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014, now(), 42, 'foobar', 2.4);
````
