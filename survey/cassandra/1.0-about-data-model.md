# The Cassandra Data Model

http://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/1.0/docs/ddl/about-data-model.html

The doc is for 1.0 but I think it covers a lot of detail that is omitted by 3.x documentations

## Take away

| Cassandra | RDBMS    |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Keyspace       | Database    |
| Column Family  | Table       |

- Each row in a column family is not required to have the same set of columns.

## Detail

- the keyspace is the container for your application data, similar to a database or schema in a relational database
- Inside the keyspace are one or more column family objects, which are analogous to tables
- Column families contain columns, and a set of related columns is identified by an application-supplied row key. Each row in a column family is not required to have the same set of columns.
