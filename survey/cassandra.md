# Cassandra

## Usage

For Fedora `sudo systemctl start docker.service` might be needed

- `docker run --name tsdb-cassandra -p 9042:9042 -d cassandra:3.9`
  - `docker stop tsdb-cassandra`
  - `docker start tsdb-cassandra`
- `docker exec -it tsdb-cassandra bash`

## Compact storage

- https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_reference/cqlCreateTable.html#refClstrOrdr__cql-compact-storage
- **For Cassandra 3.0 and later, the storage engine is much more efficient at storing data, and compact storage is not necessary.**

[Does CQL support dynamic columns / wide rows (2013)](http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/does-cql-support-dynamic-columns-wide-rows)

> Thus, the way to model dynamic cells in CQL is with a compound primary key. For the gory details on things like CompositeType, see my previous post.

- Cassandra used to be kind of schema less
  - > Using UUIDs as a surrogate key is common in Cassandra, so that you donâ€™t need to worry about sequence or autoincrement synchronization across multiple machines
- [ ] TODO: OpenTSDB has said Cassandra does not handle UUID generation
  - > Additionally, because Cassandra doesn't support atomic mutations, locking for atomic increments is implemented by writing a special lock column and checking the timestamps to see who won with retries if acquisition failed. That means UID assignments will be messy
